## Setting up the experiments for offline usage

### Configure iPad settings

- Ensure that Safari's Reading List is stored offline: Go to `Settings > Safari`, then scroll to the bottom and toggle on **Automatically Save Offline** under where it says "Reading List".

- Ensure that downloads (participant responses!) are stored locally: Go to `Settings > Safari > Downloads`, then select the **On My iPad** option.

  - It might be okay to store the files on iCloud Drive, but this really depends on your iCloud settings. The most important thing is that iCloud doesn't try to automatically delete the files or lose track of the files during intermittent syncing. (Idk, I've had back luck in the past with iCloud syncing lol.)

- Prevent downloads from automatically deleting: Go to `Settings > Safari > Downloads > Remove Download List Items`, then select the **Manually** option.

- Disable tap-to-zoom: Go to `Settings > Accessibility > Zoom`, then toggle off the topmost slider.

### Save the experiments

Save each experiment link to Safari's Reading List:

1. Connect to wifi.

2. Navigate to the experiment page in Safari. (Do NOT start the experiment.)
  
3. Click the ![](../_static/images/iOS-share.svg){height=1em} icon in the toolbar, then select **Add to Reading List**:
  
<img align="center" style="width:80%;max-width:30rem;border:1px solid #ccc;display:block;margin:auto" src="../_static/images/reading-list-1.png"/>
   
4. Click the ![](../_static/images/sidebar.svg){height=1em} icon to open the sidebar: 

<img align="center" style="width:80%;max-width:30rem;border:1px solid #ccc;display:block;margin:auto" src="../_static/images/reading-list-2.png"/>

5. Navigate to the Reading List:
  
<img align="center" style="width:80%;max-width:30rem;border:1px solid #ccc;display:block;margin:auto" src="../_static/images/reading-list-3.png"/>
  
6. Click on the experiment link in the Reading List, then keep refreshing the page until you see a **version number**---e.g., [v.0]---appear in the Reading List:
  
<img align="center" style="width:80%;max-width:30rem;border:1px solid #ccc;display:block;margin:auto" src="../_static/images/reading-list-4.png"/>

7. Confirm that it says <span style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;color:limegreen">ready!</span> on the screen (this may take a minute, since Safari may still be caching the experiment resources):

<img align="center" style="width:80%;max-width:30rem;border:1px solid #ccc;display:block;margin:auto" src="../_static/images/ready.png"/>
  
8. Close the experiment tab, then disconnect from wifi.
  
9. Re-navigate to the Reading List, then re-open the experiment.
  
10. **Walk through the experiment to confirm that it works offline.**
  
    - If the experiment doesn't run properly, re-connect to wifi and try steps 4-9 again. If troubles persist, let me know!
    
**Lastly:** Run through steps 1--8 for this page as well, then confirm that you can access this page offline.

### Experiment vesioning

The experiment version numbers in the Reading List should match the version number at the top of this document (assuming you're connected to wifi as you read this document). If the version numbers match, then you have the latest version of the experiments loaded on the iPad. **If the version numbers don't match, repeat steps 6--10 above.**

## Running the experiments

1. Lock the screen in vertical (portrait) orientation. This will maximize the size of the stimuli.

2. Navigate to the Reading List in Safari and click on the desired experiment link. (Tip: Close all other tabs.)

3. Wait until it says <span style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;color:limegreen">ready!</span> on the screen.

4. Click <span style="font-weight:bold;color:hotpink">start experiment</span>.

5. Run the experiment with the participant:

    a. Provide verbal instructions.

    b. Walk through the 4 demo trials & 4 pratice trials with the participant.

    c. Instruct the participant to hand the iPad back to you when they see the tree:
    
    <img align="center" style="width:8rem;border:1px solid #ccc;display:block;margin:auto" src="../_static/images/tree.svg"/>

    d. Assist the particpant as needed as they complete the study.
    
6. Once the participant returns the iPad, save their responses by clicking the pink download button:

    <img align="center" style="width:8rem;border:1px solid #ccc;display:block;margin:auto" src="../_static/images/download-pink.png"/>

7. Record the participant's ID and condition on the paper questionnaire.

## Experiment instructions

### Modifiers (m20)

*Kimi/Yolanda speaks a language that is written in pictures. The words in her language are spoken in a consistent order. We are studying how others learn Kimi/Yolanda's language and we would like your help! You will see several scenes of Kimi/Yolanda looking at objects on a table. For each scene, we are curious: How would Kimi/Yolanda describe the objects in her language?*

### Affixes (s21)

*Kimi/Yolanda speaks a language that is written in pictures. We are studying how others learn her language and we would like your help! You will see several scenes with different animals. For each scene, we are curious: How would Kimi/Yolanda describe what the animals are doing in her language?*

## Viewing responses

Use the [Jayson app](https://jayson.app/) to view downloaded results. Each participant's responses are stored in a file called `<experiment-abbr>-<participant-id>.json`. (The participant IDs are randomly generated 3-character alphanumeric sequences.)
